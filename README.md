👨‍💻 Guilherme Orcezi
Hello 👋
My name is Guilherme Orcezi, I'm from Brazil (🇧🇷) and I'm 20. I'm studying Systems Analysis and Development, interested in fullstack technology. I've been studying a lot about NodeJS and React, enjoying everything that wonderful Javascript has to offer, as I see a promising future for this stack with React Native on mobile. Student of the 13th class of Rocketseat's GoStack bootcamp.

Would you like to find me?
